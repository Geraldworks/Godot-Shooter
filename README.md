# Godot-Shooter

A top-down shooter game (similar to Vampire Survivors) to learn about Godot and the process behind building games 

## Getting Started
Currently, the entire project is prototyped for faster development (using `ColorRect`)

- Clone the project
- Enable `main.tscn` as the main scene
- Start the game

## Difficulties encountered
- Designing reusable and maintainable code is INCREDIBLY challenging
- Keeping track of various game states requires a lot of thought

## Features to implement
- [x] Basic enemy spawner
- [ ] 2 - 3 different enemies
- [x] Weapon pick-ups
- [x] 2 - 3 different weapons
- [ ] HUD to display game information
- [ ] Player IFrames when hit
- [ ] Proper sprites
- [ ] Sound effects

## Intended learning outcomes
- [ ] Understanding design patterns
- [ ] Understanding Godot engine
- [ ] Understanding the game development process
- [ ] Appreciating the importance of decoupled, maintainable code
